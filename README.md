# Bifurcations using ZigZag (BuZZ)

** NOTE! BuZZ has been moved to a new home. It is now kept in [teaspoon](https://github.com/lizliz/teaspoon). Documentation can be found [here](https://lizliz.github.io/teaspoon/buzz.html) **

## Description

This package provides python code to compute zigzag persistence from point cloud data by leveraging code from Dionysus 2.

See Examples folder for examples of usage.

## Installation

Will be improved eventually, but for now add to your ``.bashrc``:

```export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/BuZZ"```

## Requirements

Must have Dionysus 2 installed. Can install with

```pip install dionysus```
